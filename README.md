# Speech_Emotion_Recognition

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is an intriguing field that aims to automatically detect and understand emotions conveyed through speech signals. One popular approach to SER is utilizing the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, a type of artificial neural network (ANN) known for its ability to learn complex patterns. When combined with the RAVDESS dataset, which contains a diverse collection of emotional speech samples, it offers a promising avenue for accurate and robust emotion recognition systems. The goal of speech emotion recognition using the MLP classifier and the RAVDESS dataset is to develop a system that can effectively analyze speech signals and accurately classify the underlying emotions being expressed. By extracting relevant acoustic features from the speech data, such as spectral coefficients, pitch, and energy, the MLP classifier can learn to associate these features with specific emotional states. The RAVDESS dataset serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating SER models. It comprises recordings from professional actors who portray a wide range of emotions, including happiness, calmness, fear, disgust and more. Each audio sample in the dataset is meticulously labeled with the corresponding emotional category, enabling supervised learning.
